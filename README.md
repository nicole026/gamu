# GAMU

GAMU is a party game -- with a ridiculous name -- created to have endless replayability; no two playthroughs are alike! It's a game full of mini-games, challenges, and actions, where you might end up with some goofy photos or social media posts ;)

This website has been designed to supplement the game, generating lists for charades when players get stuck, or providing a timer with a convenient 7-second increment.
